I used HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to make a password generator.

Upon opening the site you will see a big box that says "Generate a Password"
Upon clicking the button you will be met with prompts for your password. 
The first prompt is how long you want your password to be. The minimum amount of characters is 8 while the maximum is 128.

If you hit enter without entering a number or a number outside of the parameters, you will get an error telling you that the number has to be between 8 and 128.
Then it will ask you again how long you would like your password.
Next you will be asked about what type of characters you would like in your password.

Hitting "OK" will add that type of character set to your password and hitting "Cancel" will not add that character set.
If you hit cancel on all the character sets you will be given an error saying, "You must select at least one criteria for your password."

This is an example of a 16 character password hitting OK on lowercase letters, capital letters, and special characters while hitting cancel on numbers.
